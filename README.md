## Android app for UMD

This repo holds the code for the Android Trusted Web Activity (TWA) app that links to the project app (https://umd-project.org/app).

This is a light-weight app that rides on the Chrome version installed on the user's device.

It supports **deep-mobile-linking** viz. that any web url that includes the above url will be optionally (*user-set*) opened from within the app. An example will be if users receive a link that will open a UMD.
